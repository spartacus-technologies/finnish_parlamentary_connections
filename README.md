# connections

Visualizing connections between politicians and organizations.

## Usage

First you have to have a neo4j server running somewhere.
Then you have to change the server configuration to match your setup (src/sidonnaisuudet/neo4j.clj).

And then you have to wait until I will implement an UI to show the results.
